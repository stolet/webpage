# Bio

I am a PhD student at the MPI-SWS [Operating Systems Group](https://os.mpi-sws.org/), 
where I am advised by [Antoine Kaufmann](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~antoinek/index.html) and
investigate TCP kernel bypass and ways to speed up packet processing in
virtualized environments. My interests revolve around operating systems, distributed systems
and datacentre networking, but any systems related topics pique my interest.

Previously, I was an undergrad and MSc student at the University of British Columbia.
I was part of the [Systopia Lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/), 
where I was advised by [Ivan Beschastnikh](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/) 
and [Aline Talhouk](http://alinetalhouk.com/). 
At UBC I built secure and privacy-preserving distributed systems, 
where I collaborated closely with [Mathias Lécuyer](http://mathias.lecuyer.me/) 
on exploring novel ways for DP systems to conserve their privacy budget.

Before that I grew up in Belo Horizonte, the capital of
the beautiful state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. In Beagá, how Belo Horizonte is affectionately
called, I enjoyed some of the best culinary delicacies Brazil has to offer
and supported my local football team Cruzeiro.
